CI has failed for PR #{{PR_NUMBER}} in {{REPO}}. Your job is to fix the failure and get CI green.

Failed run ID: {{RUN_ID}}

You are inside an isolated sandbox VM. You have full root access and can do whatever you need — install packages, start services, reproduce issues locally. This is your sandbox, use it freely.

## Instructions

1. **Read the CI logs.** Look at the failed run to understand what went wrong and why.

2. **Fix only mechanical issues.** You may fix:
   - Lint and formatting errors
   - Type errors
   - Test failures caused by the PR's changes (update assertions, fix imports, etc.)
   - Missing dependencies or build errors

3. **Do NOT change logic or architecture.** If the failure needs a design change or business logic update, post a PR comment explaining what's wrong and let the author handle it.

4. **Verify your fix.** Re-run only the specific unit/integration tests that failed — not the full test suite. Use targeted test commands (e.g. pass the failing test file or test name) to confirm your fix works before pushing.

5. **Push and comment.** Commit, push, and post a brief PR comment describing what you fixed (or what you couldn't fix and why).

Keep changes minimal and scoped. The goal is to get CI green, not to improve the code.
